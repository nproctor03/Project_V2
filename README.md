This project was my final year university project. 

It aims to create a computer vision system that utilizes the CLIP model to associate metadata with
human face images captured via a webcam. The system will improve its accuracy over time by
comparing the CLIP-attached labels to a database of images with verified labels. A front-end
application and back-end APIs using Flask and Python will be developed to achieve this functionality.
The APIs include Face Detection, Image Embedding Generation, and Labelling APIs.
